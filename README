ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY:
The Corvallis WIC clinic is a small site that has 5 full time employees. The clinic has a case load of about 1000 clients including women, infants, and children less than 5. Due to the limited number of employees, there is crossover between roles. This database is specifically handling the interaction between WIC employees when a client requests a breastpump. This interaction includes an evaluation of which pump is appropriate. Based on the evaluation a client can qualify for pump for ownership or rent or both. The pumps include a manual hand pump (Medela Harmony), "going back to work" pump (Medela Pump in Style), or a hospital grade rental pump (Medela Lactina). These evaluations can be performed by either WIC Certifiers or Breastfeeding Coordinators. However, Breastfeeding Coordinators are specifically entrusted with reviewing the breastpump reports.
